# NFL Score Heatmap

2/3d heatmaps showing the frequency of NFL scores.

## Running

- Create conda environment from `environment.yml`
- For the 2d image representation:
```bash
python mpl/graph_2d.py
```
- The resulting figures generated in `./figures`
- For the interactive 3d model:
```bash
python mpl/graph_3d.py
```

## TODO

-   [ ] Refactor the Matplotlib scripts into PyQt apps.
